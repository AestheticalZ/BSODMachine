# The NT API BSOD Machine
NT API BSOD Machine is a C# program to BSOD the system.

This takes advantage of an undocumented NT API method that raises a BSOD with an error code.

This does NOT require administrator permissions to BSOD the system, this function has existed since atleast Windows XP (AFAIK).
